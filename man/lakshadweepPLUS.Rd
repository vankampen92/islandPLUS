\title{Lakshadweep Archipelago coral fish community reassembly data in a single data frame}
\format{A list of a single dataframe with data from the 3 different 
  atoll. The dataframe has in columns: \describe{ \item{Species}{Name
  of the species found} \item{Atoll}{Atoll surveyed} \item{Guild}{Feeding  
  strategy of the surveyed species} \item{Presence-absence data}{Several columns 
  corresponding to the year in which the surveys were done. Year repetition means
  repeated sampling of the same atoll at the same time. Presences are represented
  by 1 and true absencestrue or undetected presences by 0.} }}

\description{
A list with only one data frame containing presence-absence data for the
reassembly proccess of coral fish communities in three atolls (Agatti, Kadmat
and Kavaratti) of the Lakshadweep Archipelago in India. These data contains a number of 
replicates per sampling time. The data matrix marks missing data with a flag. It is in this
respect that differs from \code{lakshadweep}.
}
\details{
Surveys were conducted from 2000 to 2013 in order to follow community
reassembly after a coral mass mortality event in the relatively unfished
Lakshadweep Archipelago. For most years, transects were taken in four 
locations per atoll. Although there might be some underlying heterogeneity, 
these transects are approximately taken here as true replicates.
}
\note{
Detectability per transect results to be of about 0.5, which means that the 
parameter 'Detectability' per atoll goes up to almost 0.94 if four transects per 
sampling time are taken (1-0.5^4). The sampling structure differs from atoll to
to atoll. Certain columns are filled with 0.1. This is the missing value flag.
