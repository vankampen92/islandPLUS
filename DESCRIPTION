Description: This package reads data from presence-absence files representing the temporal evolution of 
    an ecological community. It reads these data into a single data frame that can be then subdivided into 
    different groups according to one of the factors in the data frame. The package uses a upgma-based clustering 
    method to classify the groups according to their colonization-extinction parameters. Then, it
    calculates the best partition for the set of groups according to Akaike Information Criteria.
